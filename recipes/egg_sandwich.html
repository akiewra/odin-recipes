<h3>Egg Sandwiches are my favorite breakfast meal to make when I'm hungry. The best part is they're simple and easy to make to your liking.</h3>
<h3>I will be explaining how to make a turkey egg sandwich, but feel free to choose different toppings of your choice - or none at all!</h3>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Cheddar Cheese</li>
    <li>Everything Bagel</li>
    <li>Turkey Deli Meat</li>
    <li>Ketchup</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Eggs: I usually fry my eggs on stovetop and flip once after 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>As your eggs are cooking, prepare the bagel. I toast mine for 4 minutes so I get a light crisp.</li>
    <li>Once the eggs form solid, toss a slice of cheese and turkey ontop and cover the pan. </li>
    <li>Once the cheese is melted to your desire, remove the eggs and slide them onto the bagel!</li>
    <li>Optional: Add whatever seasonings/dressings you want. I prefer ketchup and lightly peppered.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
